Installing
==========

python.org
----------

You can get far with Python 3.6 or 3.7, install from python.org:

https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have that installed, you can get the extra add-on pacakges you need with the Python package installer: ``pip``.

You should be able to do:

pip install numpy
pip install scipy
pip intall Jupyter
pip install Pandas

You can also use pip to install a wide variety of other extra packages for Python -- web develoment frameworks, what have you.

An introduction on how to do this all this installing is available here:

However, once you get beyond the core "scipy stack", a number of scientific computing packages cannot be easily installed with pip. (because they require compiling, or external third party libaries, etc.) So a full-service spution is in order:


Anaconda / conda
