Python Certificate:
-------------------

A certificate program in Python Programming from the University of Washington's Professional Education Program. This is a general Python class -- not one focused on computational/numerical programming. But in particular, the first two courses gives a good background in Python as a language.

The course is designed to be used with a teacher in the classroom or online, but the materials are all published as open source, and can followed independently:
